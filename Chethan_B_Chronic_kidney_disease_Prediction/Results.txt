CKD Streamlit Application Features :

User Interface for Feature Input:
The app provides input fields for users to enter patient data (e.g., age, blood pressure, specific gravity, hemoglobin).
Both numerical (e.g., age, blood pressure) and categorical (e.g., Red Blood Cells, Appetite) data inputs are included.
Categorical inputs are converted to numerical values to align with the modelâ€™s requirements.
Prediction Output:

Once the user fills in all required fields and clicks the "Predict" button, the model processes this data and predicts whether the patient is at risk for CKD.
The prediction output is displayed as either:
"Predicted Class: Chronic Kidney Disease" if the patient is at risk.
"Predicted Class: No Chronic Kidney Disease" if the patient is likely healthy.
Technical Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

The application includes a preprocessing pipeline that prepares patient input data, including scaling numerical features and encoding categorical features.
Model Usage:

A trained Random Forest classifier model is loaded, and the application uses it to predict the likelihood of CKD based on patient input.
Deployment with ngrok:

Using pyngrok, a public URL is generated, allowing the Streamlit app to be accessed remotely. This feature is especially useful for sharing the app without needing a dedicated server.
Sample Result Flow
User Input:

For example, a user inputs data for a patient with the following:
Age: 45, Blood Pressure: 80, Hemoglobin: 11.0, Appetite: Good, etc.
Model Prediction:

The model processes the input data and returns the result:
If the patient shows significant indicators of CKD, the app might display: "Predicted Class: Chronic Kidney Disease".
Otherwise, it would display: "Predicted Class: No Chronic Kidney Disease".
Feedback:

The application provides a success message after each prediction, making it easy for healthcare providers to interpret the results and take necessary steps for the patient.
Insights from Prediction
This application allows healthcare professionals or patients to make informed decisions based on the risk level for CKD.
By including a wide range of health metrics, the model can offer a nuanced prediction, supporting early intervention where necessary.
