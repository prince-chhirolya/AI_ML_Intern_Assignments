## 🌱 Project Overview

Planet Diseases Detection uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify plant diseases from leaf images. By training on open-source plant disease datasets, the model can classify several common diseases across multiple plant species. This tool can aid in diagnosing plant health and automating disease detection processes, contributing to smarter and more sustainable agriculture.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Disease Detection**: Classifies leaf images to identify plant diseases with high accuracy.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Identifies multiple diseases across different plant species.
- **Scalable Model**: Model can be extended to include additional plant species and diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: (Optional) Streamlit or Flask-based interface for image upload and diagnosis.
- **Open-Source and Expandable**: Community-driven and adaptable to different datasets.

## 📂 Data Collection

This project leverages the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) and similar open-source datasets, which contain labeled images of various plant leaves under healthy and diseased conditions. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets for model evaluation.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized for image classification tasks. Key layers and techniques include:

- **Data Augmentation**: Increases dataset variability through transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping).
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, or MobileNet can be fine-tuned for this task.
- **Optimization**: Model trained with Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.
