# Sleep Disorder Prediction and Lifestyle Analysis

This project uses three datasets related to lifestyle, sleep health, and dream sentiments to predict the likelihood of sleep disorders. 

## Project Overview
This project combines data from multiple sources to analyze the impact of lifestyle, well-being, and dream sentiment on sleep health. We utilize feature engineering, sentiment analysis on dream data, and train a Random Forest Classifier to predict sleep disorder probabilities.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the datasets and place them in the `data` folder.
3. Run `notebook.ipynb` to replicate the analysis and prediction pipeline.
4. Review `results/` for analysis results.
