Performance is very good

B-Poco F4 5G,4,"I was looking for a worthy upgrade to my Redmi K20 pro and I think this phone ticks most of the boxes right.
Here's my opinion on this phone:
Display: Top class, no compromises. It's bright,vivid,easily visible outdoors. HDR and everything works fine. 120 Hz works good.

Sound: The stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos gives you rich and loud sound but they are not as loud as Redmi note 10 pro speakers but the sound quality is better.

Design: I have the black variant which actually looks better...

B-Poco F4 5G,5,"Camera above average.
MIUI- Although it's heavy, ni other interface comes even near to it when it comes to productivity.
Processor Qcomm 870, UFS 3.1 and LPDDR5 - An unmatchable combination. Thumbs up.
Display - Flagship level AMOLED E4 with GG5.
Looks and Feel - Best for me, as it's a personal preference.

Don't believe in speculations. It's a beast for this price.

Thanks to Flipkart and POCO.",123,14

B-Poco F4 5G,4,"Display is smooth, battery charging speed is fine, Dual speakers are crisp, Camera yet to be tested, Performace is very quick, only 2 cons- No headphone jack but inbox jack connector is provided, No Memory card slot. Atleast poco would have provided hybrid slot.
Overall looks like killer phone at this price range. Feels like little phone gets heated up and camera is not yet upto the mark. Needs a lot of software updates.",66,8
B-Poco F4 5G,5,VERY GOOD GAMING PERFORMANCE AND FAST CHARGING AND ALSO GOOD CAMERA,27,1
B-Poco F4 5G,5,"This is an All Rounder. I have used it for a month. All excellent. Camera could have been better but Its definitely NOT as bad as it is perceived to be. I've taken some Superb pics on this. Snapdragon 870 makes this a beast. Display is the most attractive feature. Speakers are crisp and loud. Fast Charging is awesome.
Lastly, which phone offers you 2 years company warranty?
Go For it without any doubt!",79,9
B-Poco F4 5G,5,"This is my second poco phone and i am satisfied with this phone. This is my review after 10 days. 1) Display is awsome, you customise display colour profile in settings(as vivid, Saturated, DCI P3 colour gamut).
2) Performance is top notch. You can easily play BGMI, COD, Pubg New State at maximum graphics setting.
3) Camera is good enough. Daylight images are pretty good. Low light image are okayish.
4)Battery backup is average. You can get 6-7 hours battery backup on mediu...

B-Poco F4 5G,5,Satisfied....,42,4
B-Poco F4 5G,5,"Writing the review after nearly 2 weeks of using Poco F4.
I want to begin with the design of this phone. I don't think it's possible to not like the look of this phone. The glass back just looks so premium and so comfy to hold.
The UI has one unnecessary app but otherwise looks so clean and easy to use. 120hz display makes it so smooth and a memorable experience. You'd want to use your phone again and again.
The display is almost bezel less. The quality, clarity, colors is amazing.
The camera, for me seems good. Gets blurry if you're trying to take pictures while zooming in. Works well in the dark as well. Videos are smooth coz of OIS.
Performance has been satisfactory for me as well. I played Apex, BGMI and never experience jitters etc. The phone gets warm when you play for longer time in hot surroundings example when the room temperature is high or there's no cooling and that also isn't the uncomfortable kind of warmth.
To sum it up it has been a good purchase for me and I'm more than happy with the product.",414,91
B-Poco F4 5G,5,"Poco F4 is really awesome. I loved the display, one of the best in the segment. The speakers, haptics, performance, software, fingerprint scanner and charging is top notch. Cameras could have been improved but with the use of a right Gcam port, you will not complain. I'm also not a fan of the back design. You do feel different colours in the light but I guess not one would give do much time to appreciate the art . The back is quite boring and yes the phone is slippery. I haven't dared to put out the case and get the glass cracked. The Cons are minor compared to the Pros. I would highly recommend this. This is coming from the person who used the God level Poco F1 for 4 years and did not have any major issues.",78,11

B-Poco F4 5G,5,"This is a good phone, the 870 is powerful in everything you throw at it. Display is extremely good with small bezels and colour reproduction is great. The sound is also superb with dolby atmos. Main camera is decent, it perform well in well lit conditions but pictures become soft in low light. Wide angle camera isn't very good, pictures come grainy and with high levels of contrast. Wide angle camera performs poorly in low light as expected from a 8 mp camera. Build quality feels good, nothing to complain about. Nebula green is 7matte and black has a glossy back.",7,1

4camera - average

5 ui - miui you know it better

6 value for money - I got this phone in 15k after exchange and it's worth it

B-Poco F4 5G,4,"Pros :- Amazing Display
Powerful charger and good battery backup
Haptic feedback is excellent
When u play games the phones heats up but cools down very quickly
Apex legends works on 60fps

Cons:- Bloatware and MiUI
Camera is bad not even average
Sound of speakers feels bit low
Lag in certain apps maybe it's due to MIUI",39,19
B-Poco F4 5G,5,"Awesome phone for that price (my other options included realme GT Neo 3t, iqoo Neo 6) ,since i don't like realme software i rejected them (even they are good  but i don't like )
1 little worried about battery
2 camera just takes what you see naturally,nothing crazy software optimisation,but if you edit it's good  (macro waste of space )
3 design is actually awesome except for camera circle design
4 quality of product is very good satisfied
5 software experience still need optimisation but i love miui
6 sound quality with Dolby rocks
7 display quality every nice with that small camera in front experience is also nice
8 call quality is same and nice
9 processor supports most 5g bands and is most stable 5g processor currently

B-Poco F4 5G,5,Don't think negative of this phone just because of past POCO Phones reviews. This is a great Device in this price segment. Look and in Hand feel is good. The company is giving 2 years of warranty so rest assured. Just make sure that before doing any further update just check others review and then update to be sure about any future problems.

B-Poco F4 5G,5,"Product is really nice, performance wise it's a great phone. Processing and other tasks are really fast. Back camera is very good but selfie camera is average in low light conditions. Connectivity is also very good including wifi, network, Bluetooth etc. Display is superb. Design is also very nice. Dolby Atmos is something which is very special in this phone. It's like you are watching movies in cinema hall. Display and sound is immersive. Sterio Speakers are loud and clear. 67 w charger charges in just 45 mins appx. No heating issues. This is the review after more than 5 days of usage. I bought it ( 8 gb + 128 gb ) after reading the reviews so was not expecting much from selfie camera but found ok in day light conditions. From multimedia point of view if you don't have much budget of more than 30K and looking for all features just go for it, it's a quality built phone from design to performance wise. And also it comes with 2 years of warranty.",7,2

recommended to buy 8gb+128 gb !!

4k 60 fps recording support

games runs at 120 fps with ease and no heating , there will be little warmth.

always charge your phone between 20%-90% to have a long lasting battery !

*Battery Backup Good
*Display Is Excellent Every Pixel Will Viewing Experience
*Built Quality Good
*Especially DOLBY Vision and Audio Simply Superb
*In BGMI It can handle in performance mode 120 fps.. Best Framing Experience. No lag no frame drop
Cons__

*Some editing apps like alightmotion Some projects expoting time very late when I expect 870 processor disappointed 
*Some apps like Google Dialler Full lag
*If We are multi tasking some apps cannot load

B-Poco F4 5G,5,"3rd class service by this utterly nonsense broker who just want to take commisions for everything but dont take any responsibilty to provide good service also. I have paid upfront for my product and they created havoc to deliver it with extra cost. If i would have not paid that extra then my suffering would have also extended so i paid to get the product in my hand. Now they are blaming to Seller who are nothing to me as I am not getting serviced with them.
Their service is such that even they cant track out why there was delay and continuously 4 days they couldn't provide any updates by just saying Backend team is working and you will get your product by next date which was 7 days later than earlier expected date.

Pros:

B-Poco F4 5G,5,"After one month of usage:

- The battery can hold, if not roughly used. Not to worry.
- The processor is very smooth. No lags or heating issues.
- The display is awesome, 120hz is good. With a game booster it will be 90 hz. You can manually change if you want to save more power.
- The power button can be used as a press or touch type to unlock the phone using finger print.
- The camera is good, no complaints and i haven't expected iphone clarity.
- Playing COD hardly from the day I bought it, it's smooth. (In high resolution)
- No network issues for me.
- Turbo charging works like a charm.
- Dolby sound is good. Speakers on top and bottom works like a surround experience.
- Headphone jack provided for C type to 3.5 mm extension. But no direct 3.5 mm port available.

B-Poco F4 5G,4,"Review after one month usage
Everything is good but battery drains a little bit faster and some heating issues when charging and usung camera.
Screen protective guard is very hard and has to change it and they said it has fast storage but it was not upto that mark some lags are there when you open settings and charger also take 45 minutes to charge fully. overall it is worth for those who are looking for good display, Sound, camera and gaming mobile
if you are looking for the above features just take it.",0,0
