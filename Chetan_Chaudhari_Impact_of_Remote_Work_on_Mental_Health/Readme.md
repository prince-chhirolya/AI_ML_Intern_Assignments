# Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health

## Project Overview
This project explores the effects of remote work on mental health, focusing on factors like work-life balance, stress levels, and productivity changes. Using various machine learning models, we aim to predict the impact of remote work on productivity.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and handling of missing values.
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Assignment.ipynb`.

## Results
The models show varying degrees of accuracy, with Random Forest providing the best performance.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
