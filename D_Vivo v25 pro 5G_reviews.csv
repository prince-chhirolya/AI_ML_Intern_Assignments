D_Vivo v25 pro 5G,4,"Dear Reader

I bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues. So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand. It has been a few days since I have been using this phone. I can say this phone is quite comfortable to use and the screen size is good.
The display is awesome with a 120hz refresh rate.
The battery is good but I was expecting that the price point should have been 5000mah.
Charging is quite fast.
The camera is good and serves the purpose pretty well.
I'm not a gamer but i can say the gamer won't be that disappointed.
One issue i notice is that this phone comes with a few bloat ware which u can uninstall.
When you make carrier video calling have noticed a few issue.Might get addresses in the next update.
In one word you won't be disappointed. It is but pricey but with exchange if you get this phone by 20k to 25k this tat is a good deal.",23,4

D_Vivo v25 pro 5G,3,"I have received the phone after lots and lots if efforts. One should really thanks Flipkart for messing up the things. Delivery experience was worst. There is no responsibility to anyone in flipkart.
The phone is good in looks. It's just a day I have used this phone. So far it seems ok.
Pros: 1. Looks are good
2. Built is good but the plastic frame makes the phone delicate
3. Cameras are good
4. Battery seems ok but not yet tested
5. Connectivity is good
6. Charging is fast
Cons: 1. No memory card slot
2. Changing color as claimed by vivo is taking too much time. I have kept my phone in sunlight for more than 15min and still there is no change of color.
3. No automatic dark mode option available
4. Lots of bugs sometime slows the phone
5. Feels costly if we look at the features offered
6. Vivo has not announce how many updates they will give.
Overall the phone is ok. It's only hype created by Vivo.
I have given three stars all for phone. Flipkart services is very bad. I have to go and collect the phone. They have delayed delivery by 3 days and finally I have to go and get my phone or else God knows when I would have got it. They also have messed up with my payment even after completing the payment they have shown it as outstanding for 6 months. I am still suffering from that because of changes in my credit score",18,4

D_Vivo v25 pro 5G,4,"Edit: after 3 months of usase.
Better wait for Realme 10 pro + which will be at 20 to 25 segment

Apart from display phone is average.....for curved display this is the only phone with value under this range.
Some software bugs are there with banking apps.
Speaker is obsolete rubbish....no Dolby, single mono speaker which is of average quality.
For 1st 10 days as I noticed battery is draining fast.
Sim signals are perfect, as previously used oppo Reno 6 5G I only get 2 or 3 points at home but for this I get complete signal almost everytime.
Haptic motar is rubbish, even I never saw this worst haptic feedback in 15K segment, this disappointed me a little when compared to my previous phone.
120 hz i didn't feel that fluid when compared to 90 hz in my previous phone.(refresh rate I tried both in dynamic and 120 hz standalone)
I am not a camera person so no comments on that area.
Over all look and feel it's good, if anyone wants to have mobile for normal usage and they can live without curved screen, then I suggest not to go with this.
If you like to use curved display just you can try this.
But apart from curved display this phone is priced very high based on overall performance

And last if you opt for screen damage protection for this phone during service we have to pay an additional 2000 for screen damage.",10,7

And fantastic camera is also the plus point of this phone .
