Using since a week I found 2 issue with this phone are
First overheating problem - while video calling it is overheating within 10 minutes. I tried two alternate days and found overheating issues. Even I had to disconnect my video call due to it.
Secondly it's mic sound is very low that one can't probably make a call in crowded place .
To be honest I can't recommend this phone, rather go for another phone.",5,1
A-Realme 12 5G,3,Middling but not mediocre. Expected more from the Dimensity 7050. Animations are not as fast as expected. I chose the 12+ over the 12 Pro just because of the SoC and I am disappointed. Phone feels very light but solid. The camera is just okay for a 20k phone. The screen has nothing great to talk about. It's large though and decent. All accessories are in the box and that's a plus. Flat screen is a plus. 5G working fine. Volume isn't great. Realme UI 5 adds nothing of note. Charging is fast. No significant heating issues as of now. Back design is uninspired. No 4k recording at 60 fps. Pics from primary camera are good.,2,1

A-Realme 12 5G,5,"So many glitches in the software. One basic example that you can't use ring with vibration. Realme doesn't invest in software development, only focusing on external design and not internal features. So many useless applications. Camera is overhyped as it only works well with Sony lens and rest cameras are useless like a 5k mobile phone. Don't buy... Rather go for one+ or nothing phone.",1,2
