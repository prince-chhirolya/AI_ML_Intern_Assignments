C-Xiaomi 11 lite 128GB,4,"Actually a good phone.
Light weight, Slim,and handy.
But, the battery not so good as expected.
Even if we consider it has only a 4250mah battery but it also comes with an Amoled display. So the battery backup must be a quiet impressive.
And sometimes some glitches from the software side.
Overall it's a good phone for daily usages.",84,7

C-Xiaomi 11 lite 128GB,5,"After 5 days use i realised that xiaomi 11 lite NE is best smartphone under 25k
Camera is too good in case of macro as well as potrait mode
Main camera, macro and wide angle all are supperb in daylight as well as in night for whom who really know to use cameras for photography
Battery is too good but if u use internet it drains little much quick
Performance is outstanding, large size applications also installed within 3 to 4 seconds it's really superb
33w fast charging is amazing work as 65w fast charging completes 1 to 100% in about 40 to 50 min.
Overall haptics, display, stearo speakers, 10bit display, connectivity like Bluetooth 5.1,wifi 6,NFC, IR balster for remote control, side mounted fingerprint are also content in this phone
Too many camera modes as compared to other smartphones
The best thing is charging speed, super macro, and installation speed
Overall this is really a value for money smartphone",136,15

And the very impressive thing is 5MP macro camera, it's really good, I personally loved it experimenting and zooming in on different objects.

Suggestion - Go for it  . But if you want a good battery phone, then look at some other option because it lasts a day with regular usage but you have to plug in the charger in the evening.",82,13

Overall good value for money phone, I suggest to buy this phone under 24k but remember this is not a gaming phone. If you need a phone like this + for gaming too then go for iqoo7. For normal daily uses, premium looks and for photography this one is a good choice. The only little problems I faced are in UI which needs to be fixed.",8,2

Display- fantastic.
Camera- Captures good images, but sometimes it lags when opening camera and have to reboot when that happens.
Performance- terrible experience, can't even play low end mobile games, and even with using any other normal games it lags and heats up quickly.
Call- I don't know what is happening with call, when I receive a call I get a rington and after a delay of 10-20 seconds I get pop up of incoming calls. Worst!

Battery- battery is excellent

User interface is worst. I will give you nightmare. When you switch apps to put OTP, it will close the current page and pick the cache data which lead to a fail transaction.

And also on white background upper screen feels more brighter than lower part of screen, so if you are considering this phone for display than you should purchase it offline and check its display panel properly.",8,7
