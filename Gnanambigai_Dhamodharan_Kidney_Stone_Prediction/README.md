**Kidney Stone Prediction Using Urine Analysis**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of kidney stone formation based on urine analysis data. The dataset contains various features related to urine composition, including specific gravity, pH, osmo, conductivity, urea, and calcium levels. By applying machine learning models, the project predicts whether an individual is at risk for kidney stones.

**Dataset**
The dataset used consists of 79 specimens with the following features:

gravity: Specific gravity of urine.
ph: pH level.
osmo: Osmolarity (measure of solute concentration).
cond: Conductivity.
urea: Urea concentration.
calc: Calcium concentration.
target: Binary label indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of kidney stones.
Project Structure
kidney_stone_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the code, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and resampling for handling data imbalance.

**To run this project, you will need:**

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
**Required libraries:**
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
imblearn
**Steps in the Project**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized data distributions to understand feature characteristics.
Checked for any data imbalances in the target variable.
2. Feature Engineering
Additional features were created to capture potential interactions among variables:

Urine Volume: Estimated urine volume based on specific gravity and osmolarity.
Specific Gravity to Calcium Ratio: Ratio of specific gravity to calcium concentration.
Calcium Conductivity Ratio: Ratio of calcium concentration to conductivity.
Calcium and pH Product: Interaction between calcium concentration and pH level.
Urea and pH Product: Interaction between urea concentration and pH level.
Osmolarity and Calcium Product: Interaction between osmolarity and calcium concentration.
3. Handling Data Imbalance
The target variable was imbalanced, so Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to create synthetic samples for the minority class.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
Trained and evaluated several machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Metrics used for evaluation:

Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-validation was used to assess the robustness of models.

5. Model Ensembling
Combined predictions from Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting using a Voting Classifier for a final prediction.

6. Feature Importance
Feature importance analysis was conducted using the Random Forest model to determine which features contributed most to the prediction.

**Results**
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of ~69% on the test set.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Achieved an accuracy of ~63% on the test set.
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models showed slight improvements over Logistic Regression.
The ensemble model combined the strengths of all models, showing comparable performance.
**Conclusion**
The project demonstrated the feasibility of predicting kidney stone formation based on urine analysis data using machine learning techniques. Feature engineering and handling data imbalance were essential steps in improving model performance.

**Usage**
To replicate the analysis:

Open kidney_stone_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.
**Future Work**
