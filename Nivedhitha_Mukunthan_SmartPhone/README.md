The Project consists of a Dataset of SmartPhones along with their Features such as Brands,Models,Colors and etc...
The ultimate aim of this project is to predict the selling price of the smart phones.
This is achieved by testing various Machine Learning models and finding out which model suits the best for the data set.
The data consists of Null values and skews which was treated before assigning it to a model.
The Null values was treated using "MEAN" method and the outliers was treated using "IQR" method.
Various Models was being tested such as "Decision Tree","Random Forest","Extra tree regressor" and so on.
Where "Extra Tree regressor" seems to fit the Data set by veryfing "R2 Score","MAE","MSE".
Hence "Extra Tree regressor" was chosen for the data and prediction of the selling price has been achieved.
